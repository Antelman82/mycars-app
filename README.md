# mycars-app

## Project #4: 

The main objective of this project was to be challenged to build a Django project on my own. I plan on building a full-stack Django app utilizing Django templates.
- I plan to have at least 2 models
- Implement full CRUD
- Utilize user authentication

## Necessary Deliverables
https://git.generalassemb.ly/jdr-0127/django-project
> Your submission must include all of the following:
>
> 1. Your project idea (a brief 2-3 sentence description of your app)
> 1. A list of your models and their properties
>
> Your project is due on the Monday, April 13th 8am CST. Create an issue on Python Project Repo Issues containing:
>
> - A link to your repository
> The repository for your project should include:
>
> - A working Django application built by you that meets the technical requirements above.
> - Frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
> - A readme.md file in the root of your repo that follows good standards of documentation (i.e. explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, features, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.)

## Bonus

If you complete the core requirements, try to implement at least one of the following bonus options by working through the
appropriate section of the Django documentation as well as by doing your own
research.

#### Make sure to create a branch

### [Image Uploads](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/file-uploads/)

Add an `image` property to the `Fad` model and read through the documentation on
handling
[file uploads](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/http/file-uploads/).

### Django Social Authentication

Now that we have a basic authentication setup in place, let's expand on it so
that users can sign in using their favorite social media app.

Social Authentication is using social media platforms (like Facebook and
Twitter) for your authentication. For the remainder of class, work on getting
social authentication working in tunr using
[`social-auth-app-django`](https://github.com/python-social-auth/social-app-django).

Use the [documentation](http://python-social-auth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or
[this walkthrough](https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/10/24/how-to-add-social-login-to-django.html).

### [Django Rest Framework](https://git.generalassemb.ly/jdr-0127/django-rest-framework)

Use the [Django Rest Framework Lesson](https://git.generalassemb.ly/jdr-0127/django-rest-framework) to convert your app into a Rest-ful API.

### [Class-based Views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/)

The views we've been writing have been functions, but Django provides the
ability to define views as Python classes. Read through the documentation on
[Class-based views](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/class-based-views/).

### [Testing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/)

Unit testing is a great way of making sure your code works the way you expect it
to. Read through the documentation on
[testing Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/topics/testing/) and add
tests to your application.

### [Deployment](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/wsgi/)

How great would it be if you could deploy your app for others to use? Read
through the documentation on
[deploying Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/howto/deployment/) and
get your application out there.

> Note: If you pick deployment cause you think it's going to be easy (you've
> already done it before) then you may be in for a surprise. That's not to say
> that deploying Django applications is especially hard! Just that it wont
> necessarily be easier.

### Deploy to AWS or Azure

Instead of deploying your application to Heroku, try and deploy your application
to AWS, Azure, or GCP.



## Deployment
- Your API must be deployed to Heroku and your front-end must be deployed to GitHub pages or Surge. Applications that are not deployed will be considered incomplete.
